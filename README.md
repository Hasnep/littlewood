# Littlewood

Plotting roots of monic Littlewood polynomials (and monic polynomials with coefficients of 1 and other numbers).

## Explanation

Littlewood polynomials are polynomials with coefficients of either 1 or -1.
Monic polynomials have the first coefficient as 1.
This script plots the roots of every N-th degree monic Littlewood polynomial on the complex plane.

## Usage

The two main functions are `find_roots(polynomial_order, other_no)` and `render(image_name, points, plot_centre, plot_scale, image_size)` where the `points` argument is the output of the first function.
